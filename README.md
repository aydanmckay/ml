Photometry-Based Stellar Metallicity Estimation

First steps of this project was the building of a catalogue for which we could have confidence in the entries. The shell scripts are the beginning of that process.

The Intersection table of all of Pristine, CFIS (UNIONS), Pan-STARRS dr1 and dr3, Gaia edr3, DESI Legacy, 2MASS, SDSS Photobjs dr17, CatWISE 2020, GALEX gr67 had 76252 rows . With the inclusion of LAMOST dr8 sepctroscopic stellar parameters, the intersection table had 19509 rows.
